## My process

- Starting by analyzing the layout of the page
- Installing the necessery packages with npm
- Building with parcel bundler
- Deploying on Netlify

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- Sass (SCSS)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla CSS (not a single framework)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Desktop-first workflow beacuse the target audience is supposed to be a pc user.
- Responsive design

### What I learned

During this project I practiced most of the things I learned before such as how to write HTML5 following BEM Methodology and CSS3 by using a CSS preprocessor such as SASS (using SCSS syntax). Also I tried to build this project by seperating into different sass files and components (not using the 7-1 architecure since this is not a big project.)
Also for this project I coded only on plain JavaScript using ES6 syntax and features.

### Continued development

In this faze I'm currently learning React.Js, CSS frameworks and libraries such as Bootstrap 5 and Tailwind CSS and In the future projects I will use React as my framework of choice and as for the styling I'll continue to use SCSS as CSS preprocessor.
Also for the writing of HTML will use BEM Methodology since I find it more useful and more workable with sass.
